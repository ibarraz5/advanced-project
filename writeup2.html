    <h3>Summary of the History</h3>
    <p>	The Web was first created using HTTP protocol. Back then, there were only 4 steps in the interaction 
	between the user and the web. It included, opening the connection, sending a request, receiving a 
	response and closing the connection. The most notable background communication feature was first 
	seen in 1999 with the Microsoft XMLHTTP. This object made it possible to send a request to a server and 
	receive a response without having to reload the page. Allowing the user’s experience to be 
	uninterrupted. However, the high frequency request-response cycles led to more problems as the cycles 
	required new connections all the time.</p>
	<p>XMLHTTP became XMLHttpRequest as it gets adopted by other 
	browsers than Internet Explorer and was used to solve the request-response cycle problem. 
	Developers decided to modify and test different techniques with XMLHttpRequest that would recreate real-time back and forth 
	communication of the web and server. Long-polling was the most popular of these techniques involving 
	opening an XMLHttpRequest connection to the server and only closing the connection once 
	communication is no longer needed. However, even the Long Polling technique was not enough as it 
	still used the same setup and frequent request-response cycles similar to XMLHttpRequest as it is trying 
	to repurpose something it wasn’t designed to do. A solution with proper TCP/IP style capabilities in a 
	web environment was needed. </p> <p>In 2008, Michael Carter and Ian Hickson created a new standard for web 
	communication through the collaboration on IRC and M3C mailing lists called WebSockets. The 
	communication made by WebSockets begins with a handshake between server and client over TCP. 
	Afterwards, the server and client is able to exchange data. Google Chrome 4 was the first to fully 
	support WebSockets in 2010, then others followed along. A year later, IETF website published RFC 6455-
	The WebSocket Protocol.</p>
    <h3>Analyses of Websockets</h3>
    <p>Ivan: I believe that websockets are</p>
    <p>Jessica: I believe that websockets are</p>
    <p><u>Daryl Susilo</u></p> <p>With the ever growing need of faster technology and better user interaction, Websockets makes it easier for programmers to fulfill these needs. Without needing to create a new connection everytime a request is being made from the page to the server, the user is able to ineract with a page that is effecient and user friendly. This happens because the page is having a fluid back and forth communication with the server. Having to always establish a connection from the page to the server, will not only require work as a programmer but slower the processing speed of the page.</p>
