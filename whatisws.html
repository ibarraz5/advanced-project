	<h1>What is a Websocket?</h1>
	      <p>Websockets were first called a TCPConnection since they were TCP based socket APIs. A websocket is
        a protocol for computer communication that has the ability to provide a complete duplex communication channel.
        A duplex communication system is one that allows for communication in both directions and allows for such to happen
        simultaneously.
        What also makes this protocol different is that it utilizes a single TCP connection to communicate. The webocket protocol
        is different from the HTTP protocol. However they are also similar in the aspect of layers because both of these protocols
        can be found at layer 7 and they do work with the TCP that is found at layer 4. These layers that are mentioned are part of
        the OSI (Open systems interconnection) model. This model describes a total of 7 levers which are the Application, Presentation,
        Session, Transport, Network, Data link and Physical layers. So the websocket and HTTP protocols are part of the application
        layer and the TCP is part of the transport layer. 
        The client is able to send a request to the server and the server sends a
        handshake or confirmation. Websockets allow for server side push. This protocol also allows for an interaction between the client's
        web browser/application and the web server. An advantage to using the websocket protocol over many other protocols is that it 
        doesn't need a ton of overhead and data in order to work properly. In that sense, it is better than using a protocol like the 
        HTTP polling protocol. The websocket is also better than others because it can easily send data between the server and client
        in real time. This process was standardized by the design of the websocket itself. Since websockets are usually used in ports
        443 and 80, it is simple to use it in environements that block certain elements using a firewall. It is also important to mention
        that similar protocols to the websocket have been achieved in less formal ways. This means that the protocol wasn't formally documented
        a group and the protocols weren't really standardized. Similar protocols to the websocket are the Comet application and 
        the Adobe Flash Player. Both of these actually allow a two-way client and server communication. Before the websocket came about
        developers would use comet channels through port 80 but the protocol was too complex to work with small data efficiently.
        That is where the websocket comes in and provides an efficient protocol for small data programs. 
        <p>
        The webocket is not all that secure
        but the websocket secure or wss is designed to be more secure. However, the wss is still not perfect. A regular websocket protocol
        uses unencrypted connections while th wss protocol makes use of encrypted connections.
         It is also supported by the web browser Google chrome,
        Firefox, Microsoft edge, Internet Explorer, Safari and Opera.
        Use socket.close() to close a websocket. The RFC standard released standard #6455 which says that the websocket was designedto work on
        ports 443 and 80. It was also made to be of support to HTTP. 
        A websocket can be used for social chatrooms, multiplayer games, team projects and 
        other activities that involve a group. In this tutorial you will be see it implemented as a chatroom. The websocket protocol
        was standardized by the IETF back in 2011. This protocol is actually different than the HTTP. The name of websocket was
        first used by Ian Hickson and Michael Carter and in 2009 Google chrome was the first browser to support the protocol.
        Then in 2010 the protocol was moved from the W3C to the WHATWG group. The WHATWG group is the Web HyperText application
        Technology Working Group. It was also founded by people from Apple, Mozilla, Opera and others. It is important to remember
        that not all of the web browsers out there actually support websockets. HTTP and websockets are similar in the sense that
        both of them are communications protocols that are used for client and server communication. 
        </p>  
      </p>
      <p>The HTTP protocol is actually 
        only unidirectional, this means that the client send a request and the server sends a response. This is different from websockets
        because here the communication is bidirectional. In HTTP protocol, the client sends a request, the request is then paired up
        with the correlated response, and once the response is sent back to the client from the server the connection is actually closed.
        So essentially what is happening with each HTTP request is that connection is getting re-established between the client and the
        server. And every single time the server sends the response, the connection ends between the two. </p>
